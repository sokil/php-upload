## Installation

You can install library through Composer:
```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "sokil/php-upload": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

## Quick start

First create HTML:
```html
    <input type="file" name="attachment" />
```

Then add PHP code to upload action to upload file to local system:

```php
<?php

$uploader = new \Sokil\Upload\Handler([
    'fieldName' => 'attachment',
]);
$uploader->moveLocal(__DIR__ . '/uploads/');
```

Also library supports Gaufrette filesistems. Read about Gaufrette at https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette.
Read abount configuring Gaufrette filesystems in Symfony at https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle.

To upload file into Gaufrette Filesystem:
```php
<?php

$filesystem = new \Gaufrette\Filesystem(new \Gaufrette\Adapter\Local(
    __DIR__ . '/attachments/'
));

$uploader = new \Sokil\Upload\Handler([
    'fieldName' => 'attachment',
]);
$uploader->move($filesystem);
```


## Nginx configuration

During standard upload file is moved to php's temp dir, and then moved to target
destination using `move_uploaded_file`. If this dirs on different
physical drives, some time will be spend to move file physically between devices.

There is another reason when nginx + php-fpm stack user.
During upload nginx stored file to its own temp dir. After passing control to 
php-fpm, nginx moves cached file to php's temp dir, and than php moves file 
to destination using `move_uploaded_file`. So file copied three times, and
maybe on different physical devices.

This method moves file directly to configured drive, so in php code only
rename of file required.

### Using upload_module and upload_progress_module (nginx < 1.3.9)

Nginx must be compiled with this modules:
* Upload module: https://github.com/vkholodkov/nginx-upload-module
```
--add-module=/path/to/nginx-upload-module
```
* Upload progress module: https://github.com/masterzen/nginx-upload-progress-module
```
--add-module=/path/to/nginx-upload-progress-module
```

Example of nginx configuration to handle upload and progress:
```
upload_progress upload 5m;

server
{
    location @php
    {
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/app.php;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    }

    location /upload
    {
        upload_pass @php;
        upload_store %PATH_TO_STORAGE_DIRECTORY%;
        upload_pass_args on;
        upload_max_file_size 0;

        upload_set_form_field $upload_field_name.name "$upload_file_name";
        upload_set_form_field $upload_field_name.type "$upload_content_type";
        upload_set_form_field $upload_field_name.tmp_name "$upload_tmp_path";

        upload_aggregate_form_field $upload_field_name.size "$upload_file_size";

        track_uploads upload 5s;
    }

    location /progress
    {
        report_uploads upload;
    }

}
```
